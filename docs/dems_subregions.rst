-----------

.. image:: /_static/images/barplot_rgi01.png
    :width: 100%

.. csv-table:: Summary of all the RGI subregions. First column shows total
    number of glaciers per RGI subregion. The consecutive columns specify the
    availability of particular DEMs for a RGI subregion in percent of the total
    glaciers per subregion. Values are not rounded but truncated so 99% could
    be just one missing glacier. Only DEMs with less than 10% missing values
    are considered.
