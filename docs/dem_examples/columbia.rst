Columbia (Alaska)
=================

Located in Alaska (`61°12'02"N 146°54'17"W <https://goo.gl/maps/WSLkyYAKqd72>`_).

The sources available are: DEM3, ASTER, TanDEM-X, ArcticDEM. **The current
default is DEM3**.

Summary
-------

This shows us:

- ASTER (when it has no gaps, which is the case here) is noisy over flat
  glacier surfaces (north-east of the glacier)
- DEM3 is obviously based on ASTER but is smoother
- the difference in dates between ASTER and the newer products (TanDEM-X,
  ArcticDEM) is very clear
- it is one of these examples where ArctiDEM has too many data gaps.
